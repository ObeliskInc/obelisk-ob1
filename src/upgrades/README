To build an upgrade, cd to the desired model and version folder and then run:

    ../../build-upgrade

It will build a file named <model>-<fromVersion>-to-<toVersion>.tar.gz in the
folder src/upgrades/releases.

This script should be improved so it's in the user's path to avoid the need to
call it with ../../
